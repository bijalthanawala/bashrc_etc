#### Tips:
vimrc in this repo can be activated with the following series of commands:

```
cd ~
# mv .vimrc .vimrc_$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S) # This command is optional. Use this if you want to set aside your existing .vimrc file
ln -s ${HOME}/bashrc_etc/vimrc .vimrc
```
**Replace the location of _vimrc_ file in the `ln` command above with the directoy where the file actually resides on your system**
